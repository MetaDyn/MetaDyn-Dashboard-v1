# Project: MetaDyn Dashboard

## Core Purpose
To provide a single dashboard interface for builders in immersive Metaverse environments (e.g., Spatial, Roblox) to view and manage agents, player analytics, and leaderboard functionality. The system is designed to be highly modular and scalable for future features.

## Key Components
1.  **React Frontend:** A user-facing dashboard built with React, displaying leaderboards, user activity, and AI agent performance.
2.  **Node.js Backend (`server.js`):** An API server that communicates with the frontend and Supabase.
3.  **Supabase:** The primary backend for data storage, authentication, and real-time updates.
4.  **Metaverse Integration:** Connects with various metaverse platforms (like Spatial, Roblox, and potentially others) to gather analytics and manage in-world assets.

## Development Process
- **Gemini API:** Cline (the AI assistant) uses the Gemini API for development assistance, analysis, and code generation. This is not a direct integration into the production application.

## Primary Goal
The immediate task is to leverage the Gemini API to continue development on the MetaDyn Dashboard.
