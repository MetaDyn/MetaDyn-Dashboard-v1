# Project: Agent Leader Dashboard

## Core Purpose
To provide a web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing AI agents and user activities within a system that likely involves a Unity application.

## Key Components
1.  **React Frontend:** A user-facing dashboard built with React, displaying leaderboards, user activity, and AI agent performance.
2.  **Node.js Backend (`server.js`):** An API server that communicates with the frontend and Supabase.
3.  **Supabase:** The primary backend for data storage, authentication, and real-time updates.
4.  **Unity Integration:** A Unity application that interacts with the system, likely sending data to and from Supabase.

## Development Process
- **Gemini API:** Cline (the AI assistant) uses the Gemini API for development assistance, analysis, and code generation. This is not a direct integration into the production application.

## Primary Goal
The immediate task is to leverage the Gemini API to continue development on the Agent Leader Dashboard.
