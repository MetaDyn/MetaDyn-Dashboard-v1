# Product Context

## Problem
Developers and administrators need a centralized dashboard to monitor the activity of both users and AI agents within the system. Without this, tracking performance, identifying issues, and understanding user engagement is difficult and time-consuming.

## Solution
The Agent Leader Dashboard provides a real-time, user-friendly interface to visualize key metrics.

### Key Features
- **Leaderboard:** Ranks users or agents based on performance metrics.
- **User Activity Feed:** Shows a live feed of actions taken by users.
- **AI Activity Feed:** Displays a log of activities and decisions made by AI agents.

## User Experience
The dashboard should be intuitive, responsive, and provide clear, actionable insights at a glance.
