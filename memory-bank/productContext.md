# Product Context

## Problem
Metaverse builders and developers working across different platforms (like Spatial and Roblox) lack a unified tool to monitor and manage their creations. They need a single interface to track player analytics, manage AI agents, and view leaderboards without having to build custom solutions for each platform.

## Solution
The MetaDyn Dashboard offers a centralized, modular, and scalable solution. It provides a single pane of glass for builders to gain insights and manage their immersive experiences, with the ability to add new features as the platform evolves.

### Initial Features
- **Agent Management:** View and manage AI agents within connected environments.
- **Player Analytics:** Track key metrics related to player engagement and behavior.
- **Leaderboards:** Display rankings for players or agents based on configurable metrics.

## User Experience
The dashboard should be intuitive, responsive, and provide clear, actionable insights at a glance.
