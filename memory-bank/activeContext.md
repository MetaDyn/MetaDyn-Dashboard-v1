# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on establishing the project's foundation and preparing for the initial development task. This involves:
1.  Creating the Memory Bank to ensure proper documentation and context retention.
2.  Verifying the development environment and toolchain.
3.  Clarifying the immediate next steps for development.

## Recent Changes
- **Initialized Memory Bank:** Created the core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- **Clarified Gemini API Role:** Confirmed that the Gemini API is a development tool for Cline, not a direct feature of the application.

## Next Steps
- The user has indicated that billing for the Gemini API is resolved. The next step is to determine the specific task that was blocked by this issue and proceed with it.
